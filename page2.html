      <h2>Psychological Support and Management of Reinjury Anxiety</h2>
      <p>
        Effective rehabilitation encompasses not only physical exercises but also psychological support to manage emotional fluctuations throughout recovery. Athletes typically experience significant emotional distress immediately following injuries, often facing anxiety, frustration, and loss of motivation. Early emotional challenges gradually shift into feelings of excitement mixed with apprehension about returning to sport, highlighting the necessity for psychological support during all stages of recovery (Clement et al., 2015; Forsdyke et al., 2016).

      </p>
      <p>
        Social support systems, including teammates, coaches, and family, substantially contribute to positive psychological recovery. Regular engagement with supportive networks helps athletes manage their emotional struggles, maintain motivation, and reinforce their self-efficacy throughout the recovery process. Additionally, psychological strategies such as visualization and incremental goal-setting prove highly effective in managing mid-rehabilitation frustrations and promoting psychological resilience (Clement et al., 2015; Hsu et al., 2016).

      </p>
      <p> Fear of reinjury represents a considerable psychological barrier for recovering athletes, persisting even after physical recovery is achieved. To overcome these fears, rehabilitation programs should incorporate gradual exposure to challenging physical activities, transparent communication regarding progress, and consistent reassurance through structured benchmarks. These interventions, alongside techniques like visualization and psychological training, empower athletes to build trust in their recovered bodies, thus enabling them to return to sport with enhanced confidence and reduced anxiety (Hsu et al., 2016; Forsdyke et al., 2016).
