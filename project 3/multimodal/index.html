      <h2>Importance of Physical Rehabilitation and Structured Progression</h2>
      <p>
        Physical rehabilitation involving structured exercises is essential for basketball players recovering from severe injuries. Initially, rehabilitation emphasizes exercises aimed at restoring the range of motion and basic muscle strength, particularly targeting quadriceps and hamstrings. Gradually, these foundational activities evolve into intensive strength training, aligning with established rehabilitation principles to rebuild muscular power and minimize the risk of future injuries (Dhillon et al., 2017).

      </p>
      <p>
        As recovery advances, exercises emphasizing balance, proprioception, and agility become central to regaining full athletic capability. Activities such as foam-pad exercises, balance boards, and agility ladder drills significantly enhance neuromuscular control, essential for joint stability, particularly after ligament injuries. This phase ensures athletes regain the ability to perform complex, sport-specific movements safely (Dhillon et al., 2017).

      </p>
      <p>Finally, the inclusion of basketball-specific drills marks the transition from rehabilitation to performance readiness. Athletes systematically reintroduce shooting, dribbling, defensive actions, and jumping, facilitating a seamless return to competitive play. The gradual progression employed in these exercises reflects best practices in athletic rehabilitation, reducing reinjury risks while improving overall fitness and confidence (Dhillon et al., 2017; Kellmann et al., 2018).
